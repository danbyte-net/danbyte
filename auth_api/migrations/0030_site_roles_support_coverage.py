"""Site roles gain support coverage (#421).

A device's coverage row belongs to the device's site, so a site editor links
the devices of their sites to support contracts and a site viewer sees those
links. Contracts are the catalog those rows point at, read like the catalogs
of 0029. A new site role gets both from ``site_role_types`` and
``site_role_catalog_types``; the roles built before them gain them here.

A grant counts as a site role by the rules of 0028 and 0029 (name suffix,
exactly the role's actions, limited to sites, only the role's known types). A
hand-built grant is left alone. A second run changes nothing. Reverse is a
no-op.
